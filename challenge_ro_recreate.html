        <i>
        I'm a passionate and curious individual with a diverse range of interests. I enjoy crafting delicious mead, exploring the world of video games, and trying new culinary adventures. My love for learning extends to programming, and I've found HTML to be particularly fascinating.<br>
Outside of my hobbies, I'm a proud dog parent to Mika, a 9-year-old German Shepherd. I'm a sports enthusiast, with a particular fondness for lacrosse and baseball. My favorite teams are the Rockies and Diamondbacks, and I recently relocated to Phoenix from Denver.<br>
When it comes to food, I have a weakness for burritos and chicken Parmesan in all its forms. I'm always eager to discover new experiences and expand my horizons.<a href="https://uat.edu">Click here</a>to go to UAT<br>
